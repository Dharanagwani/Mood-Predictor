# 🧠 Mood Predictor App

A simple yet creative web app built using **React** that predicts the user's mood based on what they type — and responds with mood-based **quotes**, **recommendations**, and **a changing background**.

> 🌟 Built with 💙 to experiment with mood-driven UI and explore future possibilities with AI integration!

## ✨ Features

- 📝 **User Input** — Type how you're feeling.
- 🧠 **Mood Prediction** — Basic text matching to detect your mood.
- 🎨 **Dynamic UI** — Background and content changes based on the mood.
- 💬 **Quotes & Recommendations** — Each mood comes with personalized motivation.
- 🔁 **Reset Button** — Easily clear and try again.

## 📌 Note

This app currently supports a **limited set of moods** such as:

- Happy 😊  
- Sad 😢  
- Anxious 😰  
- Tired 😴  
- Angry 😡  
- Excited 😄  

The mood detection is **manually handled** through string-matching in JavaScript.  
I'm planning to **upgrade it using AI/NLP in future versions** for smarter and more personalized predictions! 🤖
